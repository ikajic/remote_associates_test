	<B>Format.</B>  Appendix A will be useful to anyone wishing to use our free 
association norms 
to set up their own database.  We use Omnis 5 for this purpose, but other databases will 
work too 
(e.g., FileMaster), and the main advantage of such databases is that they can be used as on-
line 
search-and-sort engines for creating lists of words with particular attributes.<P>

	The fields appearing in Appendix A are separated by commas in text format so that 
the 
document can be opened in a variety of different programs and databases, e.g., it can be 
opened in 
a column format in StatView, Excel, and other database programs. The files are labeled 
Cue-Target 
Pairs followed by a letter designation indicating that cues beginning with the designated 
letters can 
be found in this field, e.g., &quot;Cue Target Pairs.A-B&quot; means that normed words 
beginning with the 
letters A or B and their responses can be found in this file.  In this format, data for 5,019 
normed 
words and their 72,176 responses can be found. For each file, 31 data fields are presented 
so that 
the total matrix size when pooled across beginning letters is 31 columns by 72,176 rows.  
There 
are potential data entries for 2,237,456 cells in this matrix.  A file containing the entire 
matrix was 
not provided because we thought that it would be too large to open on some computer 
systems.  
Instead, we provide smaller files based on 8 letter groupings, i.e., A-B, C, D-F, G-K, L-
O, P-R, 
S, T-Z.  Grouped in this way, the files are approximately the same size and this procedure 
was 
followed for the other appendices as well.  <P>

	<B>Data.</B>  The first column or field in each file presents the normed words or 
<I>Cues</I> listed in 
alphabetical order, and the second field presents their responses or <I>Targets</I>.  In this 
format, the 
cues and their responses (targets) are presented as pairs.  We refer to these items as cue-
target pairs 
because of how such items are selected for use in research in our area of memory.  Targets 
are 
selected as words to be studied in memory experiments, and cues are used to prompt their 
recall. 
Given the wide variation in word properties, the norms are used for constructing lists of 
pairs that 
systematically vary in some properties while holding other properties constant.  <P>

	As a result of incorporating the norms into a database program, our list construction 
processes have entered the computer age and it is now feasible to control certain word 
attributes 
while varying others with greater degrees of rigor than ever before.   For example, by 
imposing 
search restrictions on the targets in the pool, such as reporting only words that occur 50 or 
more 
times per million, that have a concreteness rating of 4.8 or greater, and that have no more 
than 16 
and no fewer than 8 associates, all words whose associates are connected to an average of 
3 other 
associates in the set can be reported.  Instead of selecting words on only a single attribute 
such as 
frequency, they can be selected on the basis of a multitude of attributes while 
simultaneously 
holding other attributes constant.  This capability also holds for pairs of related words.  
Instead of 
selecting attribute levels for manipulation blindly, the distribution of values can be plotted 
and then 
cutoffs marking extreme values can be set with full knowledge of the form of the 
distribution, its 
mean and its variance.  Moreover, instead of selecting items to be representative of some 
particular 
dimension of interest, items can be selected randomly with normative values used after data 
collection to develop prediction equations for various tasks.  In short, there may be no end 
to the 
uses to which a database of this sort might be applied.  Our experience has been that list 
construction processes take more rather than less time since we created the database, but the 
final 
product is far superior because the &quot;noise&quot; resulting from uncontrolled factors 
can be substantially 
reduced. With less noise in the lists, more subtle main effects can be detected with greater 
ease and 
shy but theoretically interesting interaction effects become more bold.  In general, 
Appendix A can 
be used for selecting pairs of related words that have been produced by two or more 
subjects in 
free association, but by incorporating the information in Appendix A into a database 
program the 
materials can be manipulated and selected in much more sophisticated ways.  <P>

	The remaining fields present information about the pairs or the individual words 
comprising them.  The 3rd field, called NORMED?, indicates whether the target word in 
the pair 
has been normed by a separate group of participants.  A Y stands for &quot;yes&quot; and 
indicates that the 
target has been normed and an N stands for &quot;no&quot; indicating that it has not been 
normed.  Of the 
72,176 responses or targets appearing in the database 8,557 have not been normed and 
therefore 
cells that depend on normative information for these items have been left blank.  This 
means that 
data are provided for only 63,619 of the 72, 176 responses.  These responses comprise the 
5,019 
normed words produced redundantly by different cues, e.g., 18 different words produce 
ABILITY 
as a response.  The Normed? field is particularly important for researchers wishing to select 
pairs 
with known forward (cue-to-target) and backward (from target-to-cue) strengths.  Those 
tempted 
to infer the strength of the backward connection from the strength of the forward 
connection 
should beware.  The correlation between forward and backward strength for cues whose 
targets 
have been normed is positive but not high, r = .29 (n = 63,619), and the chances of 
correctly 
guessing back strengths from knowledge of forward strengths are low.<P>

	The 4th field is called #G which stands for the number of participants serving in the 
group 
norming the word, and the 5th field is called #P for the number of participants producing a 
particular response.  The 6th field is called FSG which stands for forward strength or what 
has 
sometimes been called cue-to-target strength.  This value is calculated in the traditional way 
by 
dividing #P by #G which gives the proportion of subjects in the group who produce a 
particular 
target in the presence of the cue word.  For example, for the word ABILITY, 17 out of the 
143 
participants in the group produced CAPABILITY as a response, so FSG for this pair is 
calculated 
to be .119.  From this value we assume that it is reasonable to infer that the probability of 
producing CAPABILITY in the presence of ABILITY in the absence of studying either of 
these 
words in an experimental context is approximately .119.  Each of the files in Appendix A 
was 
sorted first on the beginning letter of the normed cue word, then by FSG from highest to 
lowest, 
and then, within FSG, alphabetically by the target.<P>

	The 7th field is called BSG which stands for backward strength or target-to-cue 
strength.  
The word &quot;backward&quot; here is apt to be confusing to some because BSG is 
measured in the same 
way as forward strength, except the word appearing as the &quot;target&quot; now serves 
as the &quot;cue&quot; to be 
normed instead of the reverse.  The term backward simply follows the conventional but 
admittedly 
misleading use of the term in memory research.  If it is important for some purpose to 
know #G 
and #P for the index of BSG, look up the word serving as the target in a given pair as a 
cue.  For 
example, for CAPABILITY in the above pairing, 35 out of a group of 124 participants 
produced 
ABILITY as a response, so BSG in the ABILITY CAPABILITY pairing is calculated at 
35/124 = 
.282.  <P>

	The next 6 fields index indirect connections between the word pairs.  FSG and 
BSG 
represent measures of direct strength because one word directly produces the other as an 
associate 
in free association. Indirect connections index links between related words that occur 
through other 
words.  Such connections are often ignored in research applications of normative data but 
they can 
be very strong and can have large effects on memory performance in certain tasks (Nelson, 
Bennett, & Leibert, 1997; Nelson et al., 1998).  The 8th field is named MSG for mediated 
strength which is also sometimes called 2-step strength in the memory literature.  For 
example, 
ABILITY produces competence  as an associate with a probability of .06 which in turn 
produces 
capability  as an associate with a probability .08.  The mediated strength of the ABILITY 
CAPABILITY pairing is calculated by cross multiplying the individual links and then 
summing the 
results across each link.  Given that no other mediated links were detected for this pair 
MSG was 
calculated as .06 * .08 = .0048.  This particular pair has one 2-step mediated link, but 
some word 
pairs have no such connections whereas others have as many 17.  The highest calculated 
MSG in 
this database is .66 and it should be noted that indirect strength as indexed by this 
procedure 
sometimes exceeds direct strength.   <P>

	The 9th field is named OSG for overlapping strength.  Two words comprising a 
particular 
pair may also have associates in common, what have sometimes been called overlapping, 
convergent or shared associates.  The cue word and the target word may produce some of 
the same 
words as associates.  For example, both ABILITY and CAPABILITY produce the same 6 
words 
as associates, including able, strength, talent, potential, capacity, and knowledge.   The 
overlap 
strength for this pair is calculated as shown in Table 2.  From this example, it should be 
clear that 
OSG is calculated like MSG in that the strengths of the individual connections are cross 
multiplied 
and then summed.<P>

The 10th field, #M, reports the number of mediated connections linking the cue and its 
target, and the 11th field reports MMIA which stands for potential mediators 
&quot;missing in action&quot;.  
MMIAs provides information on the total number of potential mediators that have not 
been normed.  This companion field is important because, until a potential a mediator has 
been 
normed, we cannot know whether it is or is not a mediator.  As a consequence, MSG can 
be 
underestimated whenever one or more MMIAS are present.  MSG is based on summing the 
multiplied strengths of cue-to-mediator and mediator-to-target, and when the mediator has 
not been 
normed, its contribution to MSG is omitted.  Hence, whereas OMIAS have no influence on 
the 
calculation of OSG, MIAS can affect the calculation of MSG, and non-normed mediators 
will 
consistently lead to underestimating MSG.  This point can be important in certain types of 
experiment.  The 12th field is #O which stands for number of overlapping associates 
shared by the 
cue and target. For the ABILITY CAPABILITY pairing in the above example, #O = 6.  
The 13th 
field is a companion field called OMIA, which stands for overlaps that have not been 
normed or 
are otherwise &quot;missing in action.&quot;   Note that an overlapping associate that has 
not been normed 
has no impact on the calculation of OSG because the important connections emanate from 
cue-to-
associate and from target-to-associate.  Only the cue and its target must have been normed 
to make 
use of the OSG index.  This, however, is not the case for mediating links.<P>

	The next 9 fields provide information about the cue, information that is independent 
of its 
targets.  Each field name contains the letter Q as a indication that the information presented 
is 
related to the cue or normed word.  The 14th field provides a relative index of how many 
near 
neighbors the cue has, or what we generally call its cue set size, QSS.  This index is 
calculated by 
counting the number of different responses or targets given by two or more participants in 
the 
normative sample.  Some words have set sizes of 1.00 (e.g., LEFT) whereas others have 
set sizes 
of 30 or more different words (e.g., FARMER), and in general, set size closely 
approximates a 
normal distribution.  The criterion of &quot;two or more&quot; participants was chosen 
many years ago on the 
assumption that idiosyncratic responses given by a single participant would tend to be 
&quot;off the 
wall.&quot; The opinion was that such responses should not be counted as in the set 
because they would 
&quot;vary with different walls&quot; and would therefore be unreliable.  However, after 
years of data 
collection it has become more clear that such responses make sense most of the time to an 
objective 
observer so most are not &quot;off the wall&quot; as the senior author once thought.  They 
are however, 
unreliable because re-normings of hundreds of the same words showed that a completely 
different 
set of idiosyncratic responses were produced each time the words was normed (Nelson & 
Schreiber, 1992).  Words given by two or more subjects tend to be highly reliable, as is the 
number of different words produced by the cue, regardless of whether they are given by 
two or 
more participants or by a single participant.  What is different between normings are the 
specific 
idiosyncratic responses produced by a single participant.  <P>

	We now interpret these findings to mean that most words are linked to very large 
numbers 
of  other words, links that presumably are created as a result of experience with words in 
spoken 
conversation, reading and thinking.  Discrete free association norms, we believe, provide a 
reliable 
index of the number of strongest associates, or nearest neighbors in the sense of semantic 
distance.  
Even a response that is provided by only 2 out of 150 participants is regarded as a relatively 
strong 
associate.  However, because idiosyncratic responses seem to be unreliable members of the 
set, we 
concluded that words are connected strongly to some of their associates and are very 
weakly 
connected to many other associates, associates that are produced out of context rarely and 
with 
some inconsistency.  The lesson we take from these considerations is that discrete free 
association 
provides a very good indicator of the number of strong associates and a very poor indicator 
of the 
number of weak associates.  Hence, we conclude that QSS provides a relative index of the 
set size 
of a particular word by providing a reliable measure of how many strong associates it has.  
Because it fails as an indicator of the number of weak associates, this index should not be 
construed as providing an index of absolute set size.  <P>

	The 15th field presents the printed frequency of the cue, QFR, and these values 
were 
borrowed from the Kucera and Francis (1967) norms for the convenience of readers.  The 
16th 
field shows a concreteness rating on a scale of 1-7 for many of the words in the norms, 
QCON.  
Many but not all of these values were borrowed.  First, we looked up a given word in the 
Paivio, 
Yuille and Madigan (1968) norms, and if the word was located, then its concreteness was 
entered 
into our database.  If the word was not located in these norms, we then looked the word up 
in the 
Toglia and Battig norms (1978) and used this value.  Finally, if the word was not in either 
source, 
we sometimes normed it ourselves using procedures described by Paivio et al. (1968).  In 
this 
way, concreteness values are provided for 3,260 words for the convenience of readers 
(non-
normed words have been left blank). <P>
   
	The 17th field provides information on whether the cue is a homograph, QH.   The 
information was also borrowed from other databases that separate the associates into two or 
more 
classes on the basis of different meanings.  A blank space indicates that the cue word under 
consideration is probably not classified as a homograph, and a single letter indicates that it 
is a 
homograph or that it is likely to be one.  The letters refer to the first letter of the first author 
associated with the homograph norms so that interested readers can pursue source if 
desired. This 
information is provided in Table 3, and it should be noted that, as with concreteness 
ratings, 
sources were used in a particular ordering.  This ordering can be described by arranging the  
letters 
of the authors from first to last used:  N, P, W, T, G and C.  Other than selecting what was 
handy 
at the time, no particular rationale was used in determining this ordering but it does mean 
that some 
words will appear in more than one set of norms and this fact is not recognized here.  <P>

	The 18th field presents the part-of-speech classification of the cue word, QPS, 
which was 
determined by the first part of speech listing in The American Heritage Dictionary of the 
English 
Language (1980).  Only a single entry is provided for each word, even when, for example 
a word 
can be classified as either a noun or a verb.  Part of speech is indicated by the first letter or 
by two 
letters for each classification, and Table 4 provides the definitions.<P>

	The 19th field provides an index of the mean connectivity among the associates of 
the 
normed word, QMC.  This measure is obtained by norming the associates of the cue word 
with 
separate groups of participants, counting the number of connections among the associates 
in the 
set, and then dividing by the size of the set (minus MIAS if there are any).  This index 
captures the 
density and in some sense the level of organization among the strongest associates of the 
cue.  The
20th field provides an index of a related measure, QPR, which measures the probability 
that each 
associate in the set produces the normed cue as an associate.  The P stands for probability 
and the 
R stands for resonance to recognize the fact that, if a resonant connection exists between 
the 
normed word and one of its associates, then there must be a connection in both directions.  
In 
activation models activation can presumably resonate between the initiating stimulus and the 
back- 
connected associate.  This index is calculated by simply counting the number of associates 
in the 
set than produce the cue word as an associate and then dividing by set size (minus MIAS if 
any).  
The 21st field provides a companion value called QRSG representing the resonance 
strength of the 
cue.  This index is calculated by cross-multiplying cue-to-associate strength by associate-
to-cue 
strength for each associate in the set and then summing the result.  Table 5 illustrates this 
calculation for the cue ABILITY.  The table includes only resonating associates because 
associates 
that do not produce the cue word do not contribute anything to the sum, i.e., they zero out.

	The 22nd field provides what we call a Use Code value for the cue, QUC.  QUC 
values 
are 1's or 0's depending on whether there is an important associate that has not yet been 
normed.
For many of the cues given UC's of 1, all of their associates have been normed, but some 
cues 
having non-normed associates with strengths equal to or less than .04, have also been 
assigned 
UC's of 1.  These were items that, in the senior author's opinion, could be used in 
experimentation 
because the missing associates were unlikely to alter the estimates of connectivity and 
resonance in 
a significant way.  QUC's assigned values of 0 indicate that many of the associates or that 
an 
important associate was not normed.  Such items should not be selected for purposes of 
experimentation when the purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of variables 
linked to 
the associative organization of the network, such as connectivity and resonance.  In 
general, we 
recommend using items with UC's assigned a value of 1.  <P>
	The next 9 fields, fields 23-31, provide information about the target itself, 
information that 
is independent of its cue.  This information is parallel to that described for cues, so parallel 
names 
were created by substituting the letter T for target in front each designated field.  For 
example, 
TSS stands for Target Set Size and this index of how many strong associates there are for a 
given 
target is calculated in the same way as it was for the cue.  Hence, these designations include 
TSS, 
TFR, TCON, and so on.<P>
