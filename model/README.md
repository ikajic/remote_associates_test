#### network.py
Implementation of the neural network model with model dynamics as presented in
the paper. The network receives cue words and the target as the input.

#### simulation.py
Solving the RAT problems from the Bowden data set using the neural network
model defined in `network.py`.

#### plot_activities.py
Runs a model for a problem `river note house` and reproduces `Figure 2` in the paper.

#### plot_performance.py
Reproduces `Figure 3` in the paper.
