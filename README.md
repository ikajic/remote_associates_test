# Remote Associates Test
Neural network simulation of the Remote Associates Test as presented in the
paper:

KajiÄ‡, I., & Wennekers, T. (2015). Neural network model of semantic processing in the remote associates test. In Workshop on Cognitive Computation: Integrating Neural and Symbolic Approaches, 29th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2015)

There is an algorithmic and a neural network simulation of the test: the
algorithmic version is faster to run because it does not simulate neurons but
search in a graph. The simulation of a model takes much longer, with minor
differences in results. 

The following manual explains how to reproduce figures and numbers from the paper.

### 0. Get this code
Get a copy of this repository by:
```
git clone git@github.com:ikajic/remote_associates_test.git
```

In the cloned directory, install the package (for easier handling of imports in):
```
python setup.py develop
``` 

### 1. Requirements
First, ensure all tools and packages are installed. Most packages are available with `pip`, so from the cloned repository you can either do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to get all of them (and a bit more) all at once, or install them one by one:

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)

### 2. Fetching and processing the data
You need to manually download the [University of Florida Free Association
Norms](http://w3.usf.edu/FreeAssociation//) to
`./data/raw/freeassociations/data`, there is a README file in that directory
explaining that.

After downloading the sheets, run the script `process_data.py` in
`./data/raw/freeassociations` to generate the association matrix.

If that went well, you should be seeing a file called
`free_associations_vocabulary` in `./data/processed`, this is a Python pickle
file that stores the association matrix and the word vocabularies.

### 3. Running simulations
To run the algorithmic version of the model (fast), go to the `algorithm` directory
and run `run_simulation.py`, otherwise do the same thing for the `model`. The
code for model does not leverage any optimization, so it is running very slow.
